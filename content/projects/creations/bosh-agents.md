SolarMobil Manipal is a research student project in which we had designed, manufactured and tested a \"Solar Electric Car from scratch." And it's amazingly powerful. Spearheaded a team of 10 as the "Electrical Team Lead" and implemented a passive battery management system for the 175kWh Li-ion Battery Pack. The car has a top speed of "86kmph" and a range of "150km" on full charge and solar energy.
